Complex
-------

**NOTE:** 
For technical reasons, all interactive-widgets plots in this documentation are
created using Holoviz's Panel. Often, they will ran just fine with ipywidgets
too. However, if a specific example uses the ``param`` library, then users
will have to modify the params dictionary in order to make it work with
ipywidgets. Refer to :ref:`interactive` module for more information.
