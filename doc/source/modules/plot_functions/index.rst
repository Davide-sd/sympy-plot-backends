Plot functions
--------------

This is the documentation for the usual plotting functions, whose names
start with ``plot_``. Make sure to read :ref:`graphics` to understand the
differences between plotting functions and the *graphics module*.

TLDR: the *graphics module* provides a more intuitive and easier way to
plot symbolic expressions and to combine different visualizations together.
Usual plotting functions (the subject of this sub-module) now uses the 
*graphics module* under the hood. Given their limitations, these function
won't be developed any further.
