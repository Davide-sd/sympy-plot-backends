Welcome to Sympy Plotting Backends's documentation!
===================================================

This Python module contains a few plotting backends that can be used with
`SymPy <http://github.com/sympy/sympy/>`_ . A backend represents the plotting
library: it provides the necessary functionalities to quickly and easily plot
the most common types of symbolic expressions, such as line plots, surface
plots, parametric plots, vector plots, complex plots, geometric plots.

It also provide an interactive plotting function, ``iplot``, which automatically generates widgets (sliders, buttons, ...) starting from symbolic expressions. It allows to better understand the influence of each parameters in a particular expression, without the knowledge of complicated widget libraries.
